  # The grand goal here is to generate a Python package that can be used to
  # interact with the Discourse API.
  #
  # From the discourse_api_docs repo we can see that it is possible to
  # generate a swagger spec file from the discourse source code. Having this
  # spec file, we can then generate a python package with the help of
  # swagger-codegen3.
  #
  # It all seems like a rather simple task - discourse_api_docs repo's
  # README.md says to just run `rake rswag:specs:swaggerize` and the swagger
  # spec file (openapi.yaml) will be appear. Unfortunately, this is not the
  # case. The rake task fails without the proper development environment set
  # up. This proper development environment consists of a running redis +
  # postgresql server (!) and doing a bunch of things with yarn...
  #
  # To avoid having to write a bunch of Nix code to set up this development
  # environment (and to avoid having to maintain it), I chose to reuse the
  # Discourse assets package's derivation. The derivation already does some
  # stuff with yarn, postgresql and redis. The only thing that I had to add
  # was to extend the preBuild phase to prepare a `discourse_test` database
  # and run a migration on it. I don't really know why is it necessary for the
  # swagger spec generation, the word of web dev is a mysterious one.
